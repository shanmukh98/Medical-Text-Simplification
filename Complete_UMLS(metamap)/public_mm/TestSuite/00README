This Test Suite has been built over the years where problems or questions had
come up.  This Test Suite exercises several aspects of MetaMap and makes
sure that the distributable version of MetaMap matches our internal version.


runTest_2011.sh - Script for testing of metamap11.


To run the Test Suite, simply update the METAMAP variable in the file to
point to where your version of MetaMap is located and the run

     ./runTest_2011.sh -T

Or if your using COMAND.COM on Windows:

     ./runTest_2011.bat -T

You will see locator notes scroll on the screen as the Test Suite proceeds
through it's set of tests.  At the end, the script does a "diff" of the
"out" results file created by running this script and the "gold.2008" standard
results file.  There should be no differences in the files.
