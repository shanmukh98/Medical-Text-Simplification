 Java representation of the MedPost/SKR Part of Speech Tagger for
 BioMedical Text.
 <p>
 The MedPost Tagger was originally developed by Larry Smith, Tom RindFlesch,
 and W. John Wilbur from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
 (NCBI) [Smith, Wilbur], and Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical
 Communications (LHNCBC) [Rindflesch].  MedPost is currently written in
 a combination of C++ and Perl.  The paper is accessible via link in the
 "Related Documentation" section of this document.
 <p>
 The MedPost/SKR Tagger is a Java-based implementation of the MedPost Tagger
 specifically formulated for the Semantic Knowledge Representation (SKR)
 work.  MedPost/SKR has modified functionality and produces SPECIALIST
 lexicon, MedPost, or Penn Treebank tags.  The base algorithms are
 consistent between MedPost and MedPost/SKR.
 <p>
 MedPost is a stochastic part of speech tagger employing a hidden Markov
 model (HMM) to combine contextual information with lexical information to
 improve on baseline tagging accurracy.  MedPost breaks down the original
 text into sentences and then tokenizes each sentence before finally tagging
 the text.  A static table of bigrams derived during the initial training
 phase is used to estimate the transition probabilities.  The output
 probabilities of the HMM are determined for words in the lexicon assuming
 equal probability for the possible tags.  Output probabilities for unknown
 words are based on word orthography (e.g., uper or lowercase, numerics, etc),
 and word endings up to 4 letters long.  The Viterbi algorithm is used to
 find the most likely tag sequence in the HMM matching the tokens.
 <p>
 MedPost was trained specifically for tagging biological text by using
 MEDLINE abstracts as the training corpus.
 <p>
 Arguments: infile outfile [outFormat] [tagFormat]<br><br>
  where outFormat (optional, default is -prolog):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -upCaret - "word^tag" format<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-prolog  - "['word', 'tag']," format<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-prologFull - "['word', 'tag/degreeOfAmbiguity']," format<br><br>

  where tagFormat (optional, default is -Specialist):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Specialist  - SPECIALIST Lexicon tags<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Penn        - Penn Treebank tags<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-MedPost     - Original MedPost tags
 <p>
 Input is any free formatted text.  There are three modes of operation:
 <p>
 <ol start="1" type="1">
   <li>Standalone - which accepts a input file and output file.  In standalone
       mode, the tagger breaks the text into processing units at blank lines.
       Multiple "units" can be included in the input file.<br><br>

   <li>Called method - accepts a unit of text to be tagged.  The input should
       be a single unit of text that requires tagging.<br><br>

   <li>Threaded Called method - same as above except this method is
       thread-safe via synchronized method.
 </ol>
 <p>
 The output from all operation modes is a prolog formatted string where the
 text and associated tags are included in a list (see example below).
 <p>
 <b><u>Example:</u></b><br><br>
 <b>Input:</b><br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a test.
    </code><br><br>
 <b>Result:</b><br>
    <code>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;['This', 'det'],<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;['is', 'aux'],<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;['a', 'det'],<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;['test', 'noun'],<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;['.', 'pd']<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;].<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^THE_END^<br>
