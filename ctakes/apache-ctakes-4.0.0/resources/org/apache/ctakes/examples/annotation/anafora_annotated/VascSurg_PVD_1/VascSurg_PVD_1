A/P:
PVD - 57 M with progressively worsening RLE and foot pain and concern for arterial insufficiency.
-Etiology of foot/shin ulcers and pain is unclear at this time, but vascular disease is high on my index of suspicion. Recommend keeping wound clean and finishing course of antibiotics as already started. We will bring the patient to the vascular surgery clinic in the morning and perform formal ABIs with toe pressures. Pending those results, he may require angiography and intervention tomorrow.
-We will continue to follow along. Please contact us with questions or concerns.
